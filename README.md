# SRML2
SRML2 is a mod loader and mod framework for the game Slime Rancher 2 which utilizes IL2CPP

Did the IL2CPP reverse on my own with the help of Ghirda Assembly Viewer Made By The NSA
I had to make sure the Assembly-CSharp.dll file was not corrupted during re processing.
I also dumped the .NET modules / packages / assets to the game
